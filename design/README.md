## Cohesion (high) and coupling (low)

**Cohesion** is how closely related everything is with one another.

Cohesion is the indication of the relationship within a module.

**Coupling** is how much one component (a class or a function) knows about the inner workings or inner elements of another one, i.e. how much knowledge it has of the other component.

Coupling is the indication of the relationships between modules.

Rule: all code that does a thing should be as close as possible and shouldn't know details of other parts of solution.
