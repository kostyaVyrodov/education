# Process 

## Agile principles
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools;
- Working software over comprehensive documentation;
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation;
- Responding to change over following a plan.

## Scrum is
- Lightweight;
- Simple to understand;
- Difficult to master.

### Composition of scrum
- roles;
- artifacts;
- events (sprint planning, daily sprint, sprint review, sprint retrospective);
- rules (bind together events, roles, artifacts and interaction between them).

### Three pillars of scrum
- Transparency (significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome);
- Inspection (frequently inspect artifacts and progress to define things that help and harm team);
- Adaptation (Adjustment of process according defined pros and cons).

### Values of scrum
- Commitment;
- Courage;
- Focus
- Openness;
- Respect.

> Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values.
> People personally **commit** to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team. 
> The Scrum Team members have **courage** to do the right thing and work on tough problems.
> Everyone **focuses** on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team. 
> The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be **open** about all the work and the challenges with performing the work
> Scrum Team members **respect** each other to be capable, independent people.

### Scrum team
- Product owner;
- Development team;
- Scrum master.

#### Product owner responsibilities
- Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
- Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
- Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all;
- Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

#### Development team responsibilities
- They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
- Development Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;
- Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer, regardless of the work being performed by the person; there are no exceptions to this rule;
- Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of particular domains that need to be addressed like testing or business analysis; there are no exceptions to this rule;
- Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.

#### Scrum master
The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted.

##### Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner
- Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;
- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
- Understanding product planning in an empirical environment;
- Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value;
- Understanding and practicing agility;
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.

##### Scrum Master Service to the Development Team
- Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality;
- Helping the Development Team to create high-value products;
- Removing impediments to the Development Teamâ€™s progress;
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed; 
- Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.

### Scrum events
Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.

#### Sprint
Sprint is time-box of one month or less during which a 'Done', useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.

During the Sprint:
- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
- Quality goals do not decrease; and,
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

Only PO can cancel a sprint.
After sprint canceling items can be marked 'Done' or re-estimated and put to the backlog.

#### Sprint planning
Maximum sprint planning duration is 8 hours (for 1 month sprint)

Answers gotten during sprint planning:
- What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
- How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?
