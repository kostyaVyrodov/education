## Estimation types

**Analogy based estimation**

**Story based estimations**



## Other

**Source of Estimation Errors**

**Cone of Uncertainty**

**Diseconomies of Scale**

**Count, Compute, Judge techniques**

**Story based scope definition: scoping project, release planning**

**PERT analysis**

PERT is Program Evaluation and Review Technique. It allows to calculate the amount of time it will take to realistically finish a project. Pert Chart Formula: (O + 4M + P) / 6

Optimistic - no risks ocurred
Most likely - some risks ocurred 
Pessimistic - all risks ocurred

PERT ~ most likely by specific formula
