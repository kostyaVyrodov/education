Notes about processes and estimation. Agile, Scrum, ways of estimating and etc...

## Agile and Scrum
Agile is not methodology. It's a philosophy. 
A methodology describes a process of work. It contains concrete items and actions for transitions between items.
Scrum is methodology because it describes a process of work.
