# Requirements

Requirements are features or capabilities that software must satisfy

Requirements can be functional and non-functional. Functional requirements explain what system does, non-functional how system does

Non functional requirements: reliability, maintainability, usability, supportability.

Levels of requirements: 
- Business
- user - describe what the user does with the system, such as what activities that users must be able to perform
- functional - what system do
- non functional - how system does
- system requirements -  example, a computer may require a specific I/O port to work with a peripheral device. A smartphone may need a specific operating system to run a particular app.
