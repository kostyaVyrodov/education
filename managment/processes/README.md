# Base knowledge about software development process

## Development activities

- Processes - setup of the development process;
- Requirements;
- Design;
- Development;
- Testing;
- Debugging;
- Deployment;
- Maintenance.

## SDLC models

### Waterfall

One of the oldest SDLC models.

This model is not flexible and requires to define all requirements and budget before starting of development. You can't do any changes or come to the previous phase after its finishing.

**Main phases:**

- System and software requirements: captured in a product requirements document;
- Analysis: resulting in models, schema, and business rules;
- Design: resulting in the software architecture;
- Coding: the development, proving, and integration of software;
- Testing: the systematic discovery and debugging of defects;
- Operations: the installation, migration, support, and maintenance of complete systems.

### Agile

Agile (flexible) is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster.

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools;
- Working software over comprehensive documentation;
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation;
- Responding to change over following a plan.

Agile methodologies: extreme programming, feature driven development, scrum and kanban.

### Scrum

Amount of team members: 5-9.

Scrum is:

- Lightweight;
- Simple to understand;
- Difficult to master.

#### Composition of scrum

- roles;
- artifacts;
- events (sprint planning, daily sprint, sprint review, sprint retrospective);
- rules (bind together events, roles, artifacts and interaction between them).

#### Three pillars of scrum

- Transparency (significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome);
- Inspection (frequently inspect artifacts and progress to define things that help and harm team);
- Adaptation (Adjustment of process according defined pros and cons).

#### Values of scrum

- Commitment;
- Courage;
- Focus;
- Openness;
- Respect.

> Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values.
> People personally **commit** to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team. 
> The Scrum Team members have **courage** to do the right thing and work on tough problems.
> Everyone **focuses** on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team. 
> The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be **open** about all the work and the challenges with performing the work
> Scrum Team members **respect** each other to be capable, independent people.

#### Scrum team

- Product owner;
- Development team;
- Scrum master.

##### Product owner responsibilities

- Clearly expressing Product Backlog items;
- Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions;
- Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs;
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all;
- Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

##### Development team responsibilities

- They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Development Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality;
- Development Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment;
- Scrum recognizes no titles for Development Team members other than Developer, regardless of the work being performed by the person; there are no exceptions to this rule;
- Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Development Team, regardless of particular domains that need to be addressed like testing or business analysis; there are no exceptions to this rule;
- Individual Development Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.

##### Scrum master

The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted.

##### Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner

- Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management;
- Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
- Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value;
- Understanding and practicing agility;
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.

##### Scrum Master Service to the Development Team

- Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality;
- Helping the Development Team to create high-value products;
- Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.

#### Scrum artifacts

- Product backlog;
- Sprint backlog;
- Sprint burndown chart;

Backlog consists of epics, user stories and tasks. Backlog is prioritized.

#### Scrum events

Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.

##### Daily stand up

A short 15 minutes meeting to share status between team mates.

##### Sprint

Goal: Produce a new value for business. Every iteration a scrum team delivers a working product.

Sprint is time-box of one month or less during which a 'Done', useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.

During the Sprint:

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
- Quality goals do not decrease; and,
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

Only PO can cancel a sprint.
After sprint canceling items can be marked 'Done' or re-estimated and put to the backlog.

##### Sprint planning

Goal: forming of the next sprint and estimation.

Maximum sprint planning duration is 8 hours (for 1 month sprint)

Answers gotten during sprint planning:

- What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
- How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

##### Grooming

Goal: actualize backlog.

Grooming meeting is held one or two times a week to remove the items that are no longer needed in the backlog, add new items if necessary, add or remove some of the acceptance criteria, prioritize, and specify estimates.

##### Sprint demo

Goal: demonstrate results of the sprint.

The meeting happens at the end of each sprint. The team shows what theyâ€™ve produced during the past sprint to stakeholders.

##### Retrospective

Goal: define problems happened in sprint and resolve them to improve productivity of the team.

And this last type is also set at the end of the sprint. The retrospective goal is to discuss what went wrong and what went well during the sprint to better align the project progression with goals.
