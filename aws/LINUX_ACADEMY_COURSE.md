Notes for the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate Level](https://linuxacademy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-level/)

**Security responsibilities**

Customer responsible for security **in** cloud. Amazon responsible for security **of** cloud.

**Service models:**

- IaaS - EC2. Responsibilities: Data, Applications, Runtime, OS (Updates)
- PaaS - Heroku. Responsibilities: Data, Applications.
- SaaS - gmail, netflix, outlook and etc. Responsibilities: Data.

**Highly Availability** is hardware, software, and configuration allowing a system **to recover quickly** in the event of failure. Example: get flat tier in a car. You change a wheel and continue driving. It's okay to stop and change the wheel.

**Fault Tolerant** is a system designed **to operate through a failure** with **no user impact**. More complex to achieve. Example: broken engine in a plane. A plane can't stop and fix the broken engine, that's why it usually has 2 engines.

**Disaster recovering:** RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective).

RPO is how much business can tolerate to lose, expressed in time. The maximum time between a failure and the last successful backup.

RTO is the maximum amount of time a system can be down. How long a solution takes to recover.

**Types of encryption**

- Encryption at rest. When data is encrypted during storing (Encrypted hard drive)
- Encryption in transit. When data is encrypted during transition (HTTPS)

Some other terms:
- Application session state is data representing what customers do, what they have chosen, or what they have configured. If a server stores any data about user, it's a stateful server. For example, the server can store session.
- Undifferentiated heavy lifting: A part of an application, system or platform that's not specific your bushiness.

**Region** is a group of availability zones (AZ). An **AZ** is a data center. **Edge locations** are small pockets of AWS compute, storage, and networking close ot major populations and are generally used for edge computing and content delivery.

**CloudFormation** is an Infrastructure as Service tool you can create, manage and remove infrastructure using JSON or YAML. **Stack**(Docker image) is a mechanism containing logical resource based on Template (Docker file).

Stack creates\updates\deletes physical AWS resources based on its logical resources, which are based on the contents of a **template**.

CloudFormation notes:

- a template can create up to 200 resources;
- if a **stack** is **deleted**, then, by default, any **resources** it has created are also **deleted**;
- a stack can be **updated** by **uploading a new version** of template;
- **new logical resources** cause **new physical resources**;
- **removed** logical resources cause the stack to **delete** physical resources;
- **changed** logical resources **update** with **some disruption** or **replace** physical resources;

It's better not to specify the name of resources in a template because it can be reusable.

Ways of affecting resource in CloudFormation:
- updated without any disruption. Happens when changes minor configuration options;
- updated with some disruption. Example: changing ec2 instances size. In this case the instance must be reboot;
- replacement. Resources id deleted and created again
