Notes for the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate Level](https://linuxacademy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-level/)

**Security responsibilities**

Customer responsible for security **in** cloud. Amazon responsible for security **of** cloud.

**Service models:**

- IaaS - EC2. Responsibilities: Data, Applications, Runtime, OS (Updates)
- PaaS - Heroku. Responsibilities: Data, Applications.
- SaaS - gmail, netflix, outlook and etc. Responsibilities: Data.

**Highly Availability** is hardware, software, and configuration allowing a system **to recover quickly** in the event of failure. Example: get flat tier in a car. You change a wheel and continue driving. It's okay to stop and change the wheel.

**Fault Tolerant** is a system designed **to operate through a failure** with **no user impact**. More complex to achieve. Example: broken engine in a plane. A plane can't stop and fix the broken engine, that's why it usually has 2 engines.

**Disaster recovering:** RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective).

RPO is how much business can tolerate to lose, expressed in time. The maximum time between a failure and the last successful backup.

RTO is the maximum amount of time a system can be down. How long a solution takes to recover.

**Types of encryption**

- Encryption at rest. When data is encrypted during storing (Encrypted hard drive)
- Encryption in transit. When data is encrypted during transition (HTTPS)

Some other terms:
- Application session state is data representing what customers do, what they have chosen, or what they have configured. If a server stores any data about user, it's a stateful server. For example, the server can store session.
- Undifferentiated heavy lifting: A part of an application, system or platform that's not specific your bushiness.

**Region** is a group of availability zones (AZ). An **AZ** is a data center. **Edge locations** are small pockets of AWS compute, storage, and networking close ot major populations and are generally used for edge computing and content delivery.

**CloudFormation** is an Infrastructure as Service tool you can create, manage and remove infrastructure using JSON or YAML. **Stack**(Docker image) is a mechanism containing logical resource based on Template (Docker file).

Stack creates\updates\deletes physical AWS resources based on its logical resources, which are based on the contents of a **template**.

CloudFormation notes:

- a template can create up to 200 resources;
- if a **stack** is **deleted**, then, by default, any **resources** it has created are also **deleted**;
- a stack can be **updated** by **uploading a new version** of template;
- **new logical resources** cause **new physical resources**;
- **removed** logical resources cause the stack to **delete** physical resources;
- **changed** logical resources **update** with **some disruption** or **replace** physical resources;

It's better not to specify the name of resources in a template because it can be reusable.

Ways of affecting resource in CloudFormation:
- updated without any disruption. Happens when changes minor configuration options;
- updated with some disruption. Example: changing ec2 instances size. In this case the instance must be reboot;
- replacement. Resources id deleted and created again

## IAM (Identity and Access Management)

IAM controls access to AWS services via policies that can be attached to users, groups and roles. IAM denies any permissions unless explicitly granted.

### Terms

**Resources** - the user, group, role, policy, and identity provider objects that are stored in IAM.

**Identities** are the IAM resource objects that are used to identify and group. You can attach a policy to an IAM identity. These include users and roles.

**Principals** - a person or application that uses the AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role to sign in and make requests to AWS.

### IAM Policy

A policy is a JSON document containing AWS permissions that you assign to to a group, a role or a user.

A **managed policy** is a policy managed by AWS or customer.

An **inline policy** is a policy that's embedded in an IAM identity (a user, group, or role). That is, the policy is an inherent part of the identity. You can create a policy and embed it in a identity, either when you create the identity or later.

Policy is a set of "actions" that can be done on specific "resource". Resource is an AWS service like EC2.

Policy tips:
- if a request isn't implicitly allowed, it's implicitly (**default**) denied.
- if a request is explicitly denied, it **overrides everything else**.
- if a request is explicitly allowed, it's allowed unless denied by an explicit deny.
- Remember: DENY -> ALLOW -> DENY.
- Only attached policies you can any impact.
- When evaluating policies all policies are merged (all identity: user, group, role and any resource policy). 

### IAM User

IAM user is a type of IAM identity suitable for long-term access for known entity (human, service, application)

AWS allows to set boundaries for users. It means that if you allow a user to have access only to S3, a user won't be able to go beyond these permissions, even if you set other policies.

User tips:
- Hard limit of 5000 IAM users per account - this is important, as it can impact architecture
- 10 groups memberships per IAM user
- Default maximum of 10 managed policies per user
- No inline limit, but you cannot exceed 2048 characters for all inline policies on a IAM user
- 1 MFA user per user
- 2 access keys per user

Access Keys are not needed to be updated after assigning new permissions ot a user.

### IAM Groups

IAM group is a collection of IAM users. Group allow easier adminstration over steps of IAM users. Groups are not a true identity - they can't be the principal in a policy, so they can't be used in resource policies.

Groups notes:
- Groups are not **"true"** identities and they can't be referenced from the resource policies.
- Groups have **no** credentials.

ARN (Amazon Resource Name) is unique identifier of any resource in any account, any region, anywhere inside Amazon.


### IAM Roles

An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. Security Token Service (STS) generates a time-limited set of access keys (temporary credentials). These access keys have permissions defined in permission policy. IAM roles don't have long term credentials. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.

It's not possible to log in via group. That's why it's not an identity.

A role has a **permission policy** and **trust policy**. Permission policy specifies what the role can do. Trust policy specifies who can assume the role. STS generates a temporary creds for the allowed identity that needs to assume the role.

Role can't be used when you need to log in into AWS console. Roles don't have user&passwords and any access keys.

Role can be used to provide extra access rights to an identity (a user for example) in case of emergency. 

You can create a generic role that can be assumed by another AWS account. If somebody will need to get access right of the role, he can assume the role and get access into your account. When role is assumed the STS generates a short living access token for the identity.

![IAM roles](./images/iam-roles.png)

Roles notes:
- IAM roles have no long term credentials
- The role can be assumed by IAM users, AWS services, External accounts, Web Identities
- Temporary access token is generate by Security Token Service
- Trust policy controls who can assume the role
- Permissions policy defines the permissions provided
- Temporary credentials expire
- Example scenarios: company manager, aws service access, "Break-glass" style, cross account access, web identity federation


### AWS Organizations

It's a service for managing multiple accounts within a single business. Rather than managing many accounts with many isolated sets of logins and individual bills, organizations allows consolidation. 

All accounts with AWS organization can consolidate bills. Organization can share bulk discount.

Organization can have only 1 master account. A master account is created from a root user. Master account is responsible for billing.

![Master account](./images/master-account.png)

![AWS organization](./images/aws-organization.png)

**Role switching** is a method of **accessing one account from another** using only one set of credentials. It's used both within AWS organization and between two unconnected accounts.

The only one way to restrict accounts under other organization units inside your organization is to enable Service control policies on root level. After it you can assign a policy to a sub organization.

## EC2

EC2 is a virtual machine shared between several customers on a host. Each AWS account create a default VPC. Each EC2 instance belongs to a single AZ.

Each EC2 is capable to use 2 types of storage:
- **Instance Store Volume** is a physical storage devices that are attached to EC2. If the instance fails, you'll all data on the storage. Usually used for temp high performance data that's can be lost.
- **Elastic Block Storage** is an attachable storage. You can attach it across different EC2 instances.

Security group is a firewall that specifies rules which allow or deny traffic to the instance.

CloudWatch monitors EC2 instances. It does health checks each 5 minutes. It's possible to reduce the interval with additional cost.
The status checks of EC2 instance checks the hardware and the instance state. 

EC2 instance states:
- Running
- Stopped
- Pending
- Stopping

When you stop instance you stop virtual hardware, when you stop a guest OS you actually shut it down. When EC2 instance is stopped or any other state except running you're not charged. You get charged each hour. EBS volumes incur charges. You need to terminate EC2 instance and delete EBS to 100% prevent charging. 

When you **start EC2** instance **again** you can be on **another host** with **other Instance Storage Volume**. Also you get new IP address.

When you **stop EC2** in VM you free resources on the host. It means that **EC2 get detached from the hardware**.

![EC-2-volumes](./images/ec2-volumes.png)

Stop "hibernate" - remembers the state of an instance and then run it in the same state.

When to use EC2:
- it need a traditional OS;
- something running and consuming CPU constantly;
- it's a monolithic app;
- app need a server to host;
- when something needs 

### Instance types and sizes

EC2 families (groups (Like a vehicle type: car, bus, motorcycle)): 
- general purpose - well balanced. Good CPU, good RAM, good storage. **Use case:** average microservices, backend, small and mid databases, dev. env., code repositories, virtual desktop. 
- computing optimized - best CPU available. **Use case:** high performance backend, microservices, MMO gaming, video encoding, high performance science and eng. apps, machine/deep learning *inference*.
- memory optimized - not bad or good CPU but really nice memory. **Use case:** high performance databases, distributed web scale in-memory caches, mid-size in-memory databases, real time big data analytics.
- storage optimized - provides super fast storage, (good for NO SQL DB). **Use case:** NoSQL databases (e.g. Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis), in-memory databases (e.g. SAP HANA, Aerospike), scale-out transactional databases, distributed file systems, data warehousing, Elasticsearch, analytics workloads.
- accelerated computing - very very specific hardware for specific task. **Use case:** machine learning,

Instance types:
- **T2** and **T3** - low-cost that provides burst capability;
- **M5** - for general workloads
- **C4** - more capable CPU
- **X1** and **R4** - optimize **large amount** of **fast memory**
- **I3** - fast **IO**
- **P2**, **P3**, **F1** - **GPU** and **FPGAs**

Instance sizes: nano, micro, small, medium, large, x.large, 2x.large, and larger

Special cases:
- "a": AMP CPU
- "A": ARM based
- "n": higher speed networking
- "d": NVMe storage

### Storage architecture

Elastic Block Storage (EBS) - a storage service that creates and manages volumes based on four underlying storage types. Volumes are **persistent**, can be **attached** and **removed** from EC2 instances and are **replicated** within a single AZ.

**EBS must be in the same AZ as EC2 instance.**

ENS

Volume types:
- sc1 (hdd, Cold HDD) - lowest cost, the slowest one, infrequent access, can't be a boot volume; (for archived data)
- st1 (hdd, Throughput optimized HDD) - low cost, throughput intensive, can't be a boot volume, good for log processing; big data; data warehouses; streaming workloads requiring consistent, fast throughput at a low price;
- gp2 (ssd, general purpose) - default, ballance of IOPS & MiB/s - burst pool IOPS per GB, recommended for most of workloads, virtual desktops, dev and test envs, low-latency interactive apps;
- io1 (ssd, Provisioned IOPS) - highest performance, can adjust size and IOPS separately, critical business application ;
- magnetic is deprecated

![Comparison of storages](./images/ebs-comparison.png)

![ebs comparison](./images/ebs-comparison-la.png)

HDD can be a boot volume, but SSD can.

Main measurements of performance:

- **IOPS** - Input/Output Operations per Second. It measures amount of data that can be read or written per second; (SSD)
- **Throughput** - describes the amount of data that can be sent. (mb\s); (HDD)

Maximum available IOPS is 64000 IOPS (on the largest instance). 80000 IOPS for Instance Store Volume. 

To protect against AZ failure, EBS snapshots (to S3) can be used.
Data is replicated across AZs in the region and optionally internationally.

To move an EBS between AZs, you need to use snapshots

EBS snapshot works similarly to git commits. First snapshot copies all data, second snapshot copies only differences from previous state.

First, stop EC2 and only after this do snapshot. Otherwise other programs could update state or have something cached in memory. Data inside S3 snapshots are replicated across several AZ, so it won't be lost.

DLM (Data Lifecycle Manager) allows to automate the process of creating snapshots.

If you have 3 snapshots and you delete last snapshot, then the data from the delete snapshot goes to one of the other snapshots, so you never loose your data

Snapshots are replicated across several AZs so they are more resilient.

### Security group

Security group is a firewall. Each elastic network interface can **have maximum 5 security groups**. Each security group belongs to 1 VPC. 

Each security group has inbound and outbound rules. All security groups denies traffic by default.

Security groups don't allow to explicit deny, it's not possible to deny traffic for concrete IP address or an item. So you've to add only concrete allow rules.

Security groups can reference to any other security groups. 

### EC2 Metadata

http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data - the url returns metadata about the instance and can be accessed only within instance.

Examples:

- http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id
- http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id
- http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-type

### AMI

AMI is Amazon Machine Image. It's used to build instances. AMI is a snapshot of concrete EC2.

AMI include:
- Snapshots of EBS storage;
- permissions;
- a block device mapping (configures how the instance OS sees attached volumes);

AMI comes free, shared or paid. It can be copied to other regions.

Types of AMIs: that use EBS and ISV (used rarely).

AMI describes OS, Instance Type describes hardware.

**AMI is created from** the concrete **volumes**. It's like a snapshot for EBS, but for OS.

![AMI](./images/AMI.png)

Use cases: 
- you developing a new version of app. You create EC2 instance, test and makes an AMI snapshot. After this you distribute the snapshot across whole EC2 instances.
- you have a complex app with complex configuration. If an instance gets broken you can easily launch a new one.

AMI limitation: no bootstrapping (a filed where you enter custom commands to run during initialization of an instance), it doesn't allow to customize an instance well.

When you set up permission for AMI you can:
- privately share with whitelisting;
- private sharable image;
- public sharable image;

### Bootstrapping

It's a process where instructions are executed on an instance during its launch process. Bootstrapping is used to configure the instance, perform software installation, and add application configuration.

In EC2, user data can be used to run shell scripts (Bash or PowerShell) or run cloud-init directives.

AMI are for your lengthy static configuration (faster). Bootstrapping is what you see for anything dynamic (longer). 

It's possible to combine both approaches. (Bootstrap are commands that you enter before running an instance).

When you create an instance you select an AMI.

If you prepared an instance and installed something very long, you can bake into an AMI. But you can't adjust baked software in the AMI. If you need configuring something you've to use bootstrapping, event if it's long.

![bootstrapping](./images/bootstrapping.png)

### Networking

ENI is an Elastic Network Interface. An IP address is assigned to an ENI. **Bigger instance more IPs it can have.**

- Public instance is an instance with public IP, that's available outside of your VPC.
- Private instance is an instance with private IP ONLY, that's available only INSIDE of your VPC. With private IP only the instance can't go to the Internet.

**Private IP** inside AWS is static, even if you stop your VM.

Private IP is allocated to internal `ip-X.X.X.X.ec2.internal` DNS. Private IP allocated when launching instance. Unchanged during stop/start.

Private IP is release only after terminating a VM.

![private-ip](./images/private-ip.png)

**Public instances** has the same private IP as private instance. 

`ifconfig` inside a public instance doesn't return a public IP address.

Public IP is changed after stop and start. Private IP is released after termination of an instance.

There's an Internet Gateway that sees traffic from private IP address to the Internet and swaps private IP with public IP. When response comes back it maps public IP to private IP. It means that it has key-value records of private and public IP. 

If you don't have an access to the Internet or from the Internet, you can't just apply a public IP to your instance. You need work with the Internet Gateway. 

IGW is a combination of hardware and software that provides your private network with a route to the Internet of the VPC. (Analogue is modem)

If you ping public DNS from AWS private network you'll get the  private IP. if you ping outside AWS, you'll get the public IP

If you reboot instance the public IP is NOT CHANGED. If you stop, the public IP is changed.

An **Elastic IP** address is a static IPv4 address associated with your AWS account in a specific Region

It is valid for whole region, not only for AI zone. When you assign an Elastic IP to the EC2, it won't be changed even if you restart the EC2.

Unlike the auto-assigned public IP address, an Elastic IP address is preserved after you stop and start your instance in a virtual private cloud.

When you assign an Elastic IP to a EC2 it replaces internal changeable public IP.

Elastic IP can be assigned to different EC2 instances.

![public-ip](./images/public-ip.png)

### Instance roles

EC2 instance roles are IAM roles that can be "assumed" by EC2 using an intermediate called an instance profile.

Instance roles allow to avoid using `aws configure` to get a token to get access to a service.

![ec2-roles](./images/ec2-roles.png)

You assign a profile having the role to an instance. 

An **instance profile** is a container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role information to an EC2 instance when the instance starts.

The temp creds for EC2 comes via instance meta data. If you use assuming of roles you improve security of app. Because you get access via temp credentials that can be expired.

Roles won't work only when it's required to log into console.

An instance role sets permissions to an EC2 application or instance. An instance profile is a container for passing IAM roles information to EC2.

Access keys are long term credentials and shouldn't be used when bootstrapping.

**AWS creds options**

![aws-creds-options.png](./images/aws-creds-options.png)

### EBS encryption

Volume encryption uses EC2 host hardware to encrypt data **at rest** and **in transit** between EBS and EC2 instances. 

Encryption generates a data encryption key (**DEK**) from a customer master key (**CMK**) in each regin. A **unique** DEK encrypts each volume. Snapshots of that volume are encrypted with the **same DEK**, as are any volumes created from that snapshot.

DEK has encrypted key and key in plain text. Plain text key is stored in memory of an instance. The encrypted key is stored in EBS. Next time when EC2 needs a plain key, it requests from KMS and KMS returns it to EC2. KMS creates a DEK from CMK.

![ec2-encryption.png](./images/encryption-ec2.png)

Key Management Service is a service providing cryptography keys for encrypting data.

- AWS managed keys - are keys managed by AWS
- Customer managed keys - are keys managed by a customer

It's not possible to create a **not** encrypted AMI from **encrypted** volume. Encryption doesn't have any impacts on performance for EC2. EC2 see the encrypted volume like not encrypted.

To encrypt data on the OS level, you need to use OS encryption.

### EC2 performance

**EBS path optimization**. EBS is accessed via a network wire. The wire can be used for both transferring network data and EBS data. The optimization is to use 2 wire for network and for EBS. (Not all instances has it.)

**SR-IOV** - single root input output visualization. 1 host shares several VMs. The host has 1 network adapter, but VMs uses virtual network adapters that mapped to the real one. It means that 1 real adapter has many virtual. Recently the role of adapter was done by hypervisor, but now it's embedded into a real network adapter.

**Placement groups** has 3 types: cluster, spread, partition.

Cluster â€“ packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. Cluster placement groups are designed for performance. Every instance can tal to every other instance at the same time at full speed. Works with enhanced network for peak performance. **Optimization:** small latency. Maybe traffic even doesn't need to leave a host. For performance. Launch the same type of instance for Cluster group to make they are really close to each other.

**Partition** â€“ spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka. Partition is isolated group AWS resources. Each partition has an isolated rack. Partition are useful for big infrastructure.

**Spread** â€“ strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures. For highly availability

### Billing models

You get charged per minute of usage an instance.

Key facts: 
- Instance size\type have an AZ spot price.
- Bid more, instance provision for spot price. Less = termination.
- Spot fleets are containers, allowing capacity to be managed
- Reservations are zonal (AZ) or regional
- One or 3 years, no upfront, partial upfront, all upfront.
- You pay regardless of EC2 instance using a reservation
- Regional is more flexible - but has no capacity reservation

**Spot**

Set max price that you can pay and if the instance price is below your spot, the instance works. Ridiculously inexpensive because thereâ€™s no commitment from the AWS side.

Use case:
- servers can tolerate failure and can be inactive for some time, state is not stored on the instance. Not use case: AD service, banking and etc.
Spot pricing was al about utilizing spare AWS capacity in order to get cheaper EC2 rates.
- cost-critical, which can cope with interruption
- burst-y workloads

On-Demand price: $1/hr
The market spot price: $0.2/hr
Your bid price: $0.5/hr
What you pay: $0.2/hr

**Reserved**

You reserve an instance and get a discount because helps AWS to predict load. You pay for instance even if it works. Don't need to worry about any hourly charges.

Use case:
- base\consistent load
- known and understood growth
- critical system\components

**On-demand**

Thereâ€™s no commitment from you. You pay the most with this option.

Use case:
- Default or unknown demand
- anything in between reserved\spot
- short-term workloads that cannot tolerate interruption
