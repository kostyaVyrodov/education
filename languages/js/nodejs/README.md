# NodeJS

NodeJS is JS runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine. NodeJS uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it light weight & efficient

NodeJS is based on event driven programming. EDP is a paradigm when program flow is determined by the occurrence of events. The events are monitored by the code known as event listeners that, if it detects that its assigned event has occurred, runs an event “handler”, typically a callback function or method. Events are checked by event loop.

## Fundamental concepts

- Module is a pease of code that can be used in other modules
- NodeJS provides a special `global` object that's available in all modules. It's similar to `window` but it's in browser
