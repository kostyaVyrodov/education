## Fundamentals

**Population** is collection of all items of interest you study (N). Population is hard to define and observe in real life since it covers every item that might be invisible for the moment.

**Parameter** is a value that refers to a population. It is the opposite of statistic.

**Sample** is a subset of population (n). Good sample is random and representative. **Random** sample is a collection when each member is of the sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance. A **representativeness** sample is a subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire population.

**Statistic** is a value that refers to a sample. It is the opposite of a parameter.

**Population vs Sample**

- Population: hard to observe, hard to contact
- Sample: easy to observe, easy to contact
