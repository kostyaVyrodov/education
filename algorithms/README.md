# Algorithms and data structures

Data structure is a way for organizing data in a way that enables it to be processed in an efficient time.
Algorithm is a set of rules to solve a problem.

Why to ask algorithms in interview?
- Check 'Problem solving skills';
- Check 'Coding/Testing skills';

Types of data structures: primitives and non-primitives;

Primitives DS:
- integer;
- float;
- character;
- boolean;

Non-primitives:
- array;
- linked list;
- stack;
- tree;
- graph;

List of data structures is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures)

## Recursion



Properties of recursion:
- same operations is performed multiple times with different inputs;
- in every step we try to make the problem smaller;
- we mandatorily need to have a base condition which tells system when to stop the recursion;
