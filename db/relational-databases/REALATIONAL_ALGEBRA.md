# Relational algebra

Relational Algebra is procedural query language, which takes Relation as input and generate relation as output

## Operations

**Projection (π)** is an operation that selects required columns from a relation (SQL - `SELECT`)

**Selection (σ)** is an operation that selects required tuples from a relation (SQL - `WHERE`)

**Union (U)** is an operation that selects common tuples from different results

**Set Difference (-)** is an operation that returns only different tuples from results

**Rename (ρ)** is an operation that renames attributes

**Cross Product (X)** is an operation returning cartesian product of different selections

**Natural join** is an operator returning a set of all combination of tuples where they have equal common attribute
